# Research Focus:
There are many ongoing debates on tobacco use. These include but are not limited to: the health risks, the effectiveness of current mitigations, and most importantly, the right to use. While we cannot answer all these questions, we can certainly study the effect and overall impact of tobacco use on our society, especially our health. As there are many studies on how tobacco use affects the ‘current’ public health, we decided to focus more on the ‘future’; or to be more specific, the life expectancy of our population at birth. First-hand and second-hand smoking has proven to be detrimental to our health; however, we are still uncertain how it affects babies and their life expectancy when they are born. We will therefore focus on the question: “is there a significant correlation between tobacco use and life expectancy at birth?” and work with these two datasets:

U.S. Life Expectancy at Birth by State and Census Tract - 2010-2015 (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-life-expectancy-at-birth-by-state-and-census-tract-2010-2015)
This data was generated through the collaborative project “U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP)” between the NCHS, NAPHSIS, and the RWJF
(6 features and 73121 observations)


Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Tobacco Use - 2011 to present (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/behavioral-risk-factor-data-tobacco-use-2011-to-present)
This data was collected by the CDC through the State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation System that gathers information about chronic diseases, risk factors, and other causes of death
(31 features and 43341 observations)

The first dataset provides the life expectancy values by state through combined data from 2010-2015, which consists of 6 features: state, county, census tract number, life expectancy, life expectancy range, and life expectancy standard error. We will then adjust the two datasets accordingly as there are many unnecessary features in the Tobacco Use dataset (i.e. Data Value Footnote, Education, and so forth); furthermore, we will ensure the years overlap, so we will focus on the data collected from 2011 to 2015. After making the necessary changes, we will then conduct our project and analyze the data to see whether or not our question has been answered. 

We believe this to be a very compelling story as this could provide us with future implications as to how we could go about tobacco use in the future at the national level. It is crucial that we understand not only the issues that we presently face but what could happen in the long-run if we are to truly act to support and develop our communities. As implied, tobacco use undoubtedly lowers life expectancy for those who are directly involved; but our question is, how will it affect our future generations? Through this study, we will be able to see whether there is a strong correlational relationship between tobacco use and lower life expectancy at birth; and if there is, we could then consider the necessary steps concerning the future policies on such use.

# Background Research/Inspiration:
Article 1: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17488-smoking

This article about smoking gave us the necessary background concerning the topic of tobacco use and provided the overall context and idea for this project

There is a lack of information concerning the future impacts on tobacco use, therefore strengthening our inspiration for this project

Article 2: https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/tobacco.htm

This article provide more in-depth statistics and information concerning the risk factors of tobacco use

CDC shares its own response to tobacco use today, which gives us extra insight to our research topic

Article 3: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm#:~:text=Cigarette%20smoking%20causes%20premature%20death,years%20shorter%20than%20for%20nonsmokers.&text=Quitting%20smoking%20before%20the%20age,related%20disease%20by%20about%2090%25.

This article provides statistics on tobacco-related mortalities, including information on other risks that appear for regular smokers

This article also provides us an overall idea of how serious and deadly the effects of tobacco use are

Article 4: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC437139/ 

This link is a study that is conducted to see mortality among smokers versus non-smokers

This study provides more context and direct evidence on the topic of smokers and lower life expectancy

Article 5: https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/10/3/273

This article also provides the information and methodologies on the research of estimating health expectancy among smokers and non-smokers in Denmark

For results, it is shown that if no one in Denmark were to die from smoking, life expectancy would increase for both men and women. For our project, we seek to see how this would affect future generations as well.
